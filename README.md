# Color Game JavaScript

The objective of this challenge is to create a single page application that functions as a color guessing game. When the page loads, six different, randomly generated colors should appear in the boxes like in the picture. The title bar will show the actual RGB value of the correct color, and the user should use this information to try and guess the correct color. Clicking the wrong color will cause that choice to be eliminated. When the correct tile is clicked, all tiles will switch to the correct color, as well as the background color of the title bar.
